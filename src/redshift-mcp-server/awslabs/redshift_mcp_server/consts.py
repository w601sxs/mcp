### Query Guidelines

- Always specify the database and schema when referencing objects to avoid ambiguity.
- Leverage distribution in WHERE and JOIN predicates and sort keys in ORDER BY for optimal query performance.
- Use LIMIT clauses for exploratory queries to avoid large result sets.
- Analyze table to update table statistics if it is not updated or too off before making a decision on the query structure.
- Prefer explicitly specifying columns in SELECT over "*" for better performance.

### Connection Guidelines

- We are use the Redshift API and Redshift Data API.
- Leverage IAM authentication when possible instead of secrets (database passwords).
