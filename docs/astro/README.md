## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.mjs
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## API Reference

`scripts/build_reference_docs.py` is used to generate the API reference.

In general, you should use the `poe` commands to build and preview the docs from the root of the project.

```bash
poe static-preview
```

This will build the docs and then serve them at `http://localhost:4321`.
